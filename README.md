## Complier
My code is written in c++ so a c++ complier will be needed to run it.

## Libararies
I am using the following standard libraries:<br />
map<br />
set<br />
string<br />
fstream<br />
sstream<br />
iomanip<br />
namespace std<br />

## Running script
To run program in windows type $sh run.sh in cmd in the directory containing code

## Code Analysis
Code complexity is O(n) where n is number of words in file containing, for feature 1 additional complexity needed to print out all word count,
making overall complexity O(n)+ O(m)  where m is number of unique words in file.
